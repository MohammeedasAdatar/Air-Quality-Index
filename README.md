# Air-Quality-Index
This Data Set contains data on the Air Quality index of cities like Ahmedabad, Aizawl, Amaravati, Amritsar, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Brajrajnagar, Chandigarh, Chennai, Coimbatore, Delhi, Ernakulam, Gurugram, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Jorapokhar, Kochi, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Patna, Shillong, Talcher, Thiruvananthapuram, Visakhapatnam. It has 29,531 rows  and 15 columns.
Motivation: Windows had a new update. It now features Air Quality index. This new feature by windows motivated me to read about Air quality index in detail.
Objective: To identify the various factors that affect the Air Quality. 
Methodology: In this study I have used fillna method to handle all the nan values and linear regression to predict the air quality index.
Graphs Used: Scatter Plot, Distplot, Pairplot, Correlation Heatmap.
Result:
1)	There is a strong positive correlation between PM 2.5 and air quality index. A unit change in PM 2.5 leads to 0.95 unit change in Air quality index.
2)	There is a strong positive correlation between PM 10 and air quality index. A unit change in PM10 leads to 0.27 unit change in Air quality index.
3)	There is a negative correlation between AQI and Nitrogen oxide. A unit change in nitrogen leads to a fall in Air quality index by 0.3 units.
4)	There is a weak positive correlation between NOx and Air Quality Index. A unit change in NOx leads to 0.13 unit increase in Air Quality increase.
5)	There is a negative relationship between NH3 and Air Quality index. A unit change in NH3 reduces air quality index by 0.05 units.
6)	Carbon monoxide has a strong positive relationship with the Air Quality index. A unit change in Carbon Monoxide leads to 9 unit increase in air quality index. Thus carbon monoxide adversely affects the Air Quality index
7)	As Sulphur Dioxide increases by 1 unit , Air quality index increases by 0.6 units.
8)	As O3 increases Air quality index also increases.
9)	Benzene has a negative relation ship with air quality index. As the level of Benzene rises Air quality improves. A unit change in Benzene leads to a fall in AQI by 0.3 units.
10)	Toluene has a positive relationship with AQI.A unit increase in Toulene cause AQI to rise by 0.24 units.
